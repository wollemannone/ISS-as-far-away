###The Project

This Project, wich took about four weeks was about the visualisation of data. 
The assingnment contained, that we should use the [API of the ISS](http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/ISS-Location-Now/) geo coordinates. Coming from there we should find a good reference data set to visualise.


###five finger excercise

After a couple of short excercises to get to know how to handle the JSON format, we faced the first challange. The task was to write a program wich visualises a dataset ,in my case the cookingtimes of vegetables, in a clear way. We worked with the java script library p5js.  
[Here](http://wollemannone.github.io/veggieManiacc-/) you can find the resut of this excercise.

###two ideas for the ISS  
  
   
  
  
  After the fist two weeks I was facing two concepts:  
  
  The **first concept** was concerned about the scientific experiments, wich are runned in the ISS. The idea was to
  creat an info grafic, wich shows the financial system behind the research projects. It would make the obserever explore 
  which country or wich organisation invests how much in wich project. Futhermore there should be shown, to what extend 
  the results have an influence of our life on earth. The viewer should see wich money causes wich effort for the humans.
