###The Project

This Project, wich took about four weeks was about the visualisation of data. 
The assingnment contained, that we should use the [API of the ISS](http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/ISS-Location-Now/) geo coordinates. Coming from there we should find a good reference data set to visualise.


###five finger excercise

After a couple of short excercises to get to know how to handle the JSON format, we faced the first challange. The task was to write a program wich visualises a dataset ,in my case the cookingtimes of vegetables, in a clear way. 
[Here](http://wollemannone.github.io/veggieManiacc-/) you can find the resut of this excercise.
